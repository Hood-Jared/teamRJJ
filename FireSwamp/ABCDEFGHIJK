Map Characteristics:
1. All the dangers on the map are randomly generated
   This means you will face a different set of dangers
   each time you play
2. The start location of the map is randomly generated
   on the bottom row. This means you will always start
   on the bottom row but not always in the same column
3. The end location of the map is randomly generated
   on the top row. This means you will always finish
   on the top row but not always in the same column

There are three dangers you should be aware of

ROUS': These are Rodents of Unusual Size. They are
massive rodents about the size of a dog. In order to get
away from them you will need to be quick on your feet!

Lightning Sand: This is basically quick sand but much,
much faster. One step and not only will instantly begin
to such you in but you'll be engulfed in the sand as 
fast as gravity can pull you down!

Fire Spouts: These are gas spewing holes in the ground
much like a geyser except these don't spout anything so
harmless as water. Be careful you don't jump right into
spurt of flame!
